"""Taste match powered by Qloo (Qloo hackathon, Oct 2026).

For a pair of people, reads each person's public "Taste" page (music / film /
dining favourites), resolves those names to Qloo taste-graph entities, and
returns:

* a **taste compatibility signal** — a 0–100 shared-taste score, a label, a
  short human summary, per-domain overlap, and the tastes they share. Both the
  score bars and the shared-taste surface are grounded in the domains BOTH
  people actually stated: a domain only one side listed is never scored, never
  shown as an overlap, and never the "strongest overlap", and the only entities
  surfaced as a shared taste are ones both pages listed — Qloo's cross-domain
  predictions drive the per-domain score but are never presented as a stated
  taste. The per-domain overlap is how much the two people's stated entities and
  Qloo recommendations overlap in each both-stated domain (cross-domain: every
  recommendation is driven by ALL of a person's signals);
* **taste-based date ideas** — Qloo place recommendations near the first
  person's city driven by BOTH people's signals at once, plus a film and a
  music pick both of their taste graphs rank highly.

Privacy: only PUBLIC profile data is read, for both people
(:func:`public_profile.build` — public wiki at query level, private spans
stripped, blocked/deleted refused). Nothing private is sent to Qloo; only
entity names the person published.

Surfaces: ``POST /taste/pair`` (signed in, 18+; caller × another user, shown
on the AI Date Simulation result). Self-contained (with ``qloo_client.py`` +
``qloo_fixture.json``) so it lifts cleanly into the public hackathon repo.
